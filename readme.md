### Get started with Python and Anaconda:

- https://www.anaconda.com/

### Get started with the curriculum:

- Clone this repo or download the files into your local <i>Documents</i> folder.

The training is split into two parts:
1) Into to python: <i>Part 1 - Python syntax and programming.ipynb</i>
2) Intro to pandas and data analysis: <i>Part 2 - Pandas.ipynb</i>

The <i>new notebook.ipynb</i> contains some useful shortcuts and instructions for working with juypyter notebooks.

The data analysis examples use the CER's NGL inventory dataset available here:
- https://www.cer-rec.gc.ca/en/data-analysis/energy-commodities/natural-gas-liquids/statistics/liquefied-petroleum-gas-lpg-statistics.html
- A static excel file is already in the repo. Keep the data file in the top level of the <i>cer_python_training</i> folder.

### For CER employees
- This curriculum is most valuable when delivered through a two part presentation. Send me an email to get added to the next session!
